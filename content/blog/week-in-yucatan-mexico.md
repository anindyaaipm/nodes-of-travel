## Day : 1

 We boarded an afternoon flight from Toronto‚Äôs Pearson airport.
4 hours later we were at Cancun‚Äôs Terminal 4.
By the way , In this trip we opted not to rent a car and used local conveyance instead, which at the hindsight was a great decision. 
From the terminal we took Happy shuttle cab and headed to Puerto Juarez in central Cancun.

We stayed the night at Casa Caribe located literally next to the Puerto Juarez ferry terminal as next morning we are heading to Isla Mujeres. We had dinner at a local restaurant and the shrimp anchiovi pizza was extremely delicious.

## Day : 2

We woke up to a magnificent sunrise at the beautiful settings of our hotel ..next we headed to the Ultramar ferry terminal to get to Isla Mujeres. Isla Mujeres is an island just 7 kms off the coast of Cancun. This stunning 18 mins ferry ride has live music at the upper deck with an optional inside sitting , however with colors of the water as inviting as we witnessed, I wonder why would anyone be sitting inside anyways.

---

Upon reaching Isla Mujeres we dropped our luggage at our hotel Posada Del Mar , as our checking was not until 3 pm.. we came back near the ferry terminal to rent a golf cart , which by every means is the best way to explore the island. We headed south to Punta Sur to witness the beautiful azure blue colors of the Caribbean Sea. Punta Sur is the eastern most tip of Mexico where the very first sunrise kisses the Mexican soil.  This island is dedicated to Ixchel, Mayan goddess of fertility and hence the name. 
Next we spent some time at Kin Ha, a nearby beach club before heading out to ‚Äúthe joint‚Äù to grab some lunch.  
Next up was the Chapel of Guadalupe which has an amazing setting ; we then went to the Rainbow Stairs at Calle Pompano. At 5pm we returned our golf cart , came back to the hotel which is located right across the street from Playa Centro beach. With its powdery white sand and azure blue waters Playa Centro and its extension till Playa Norte is what travel dreams are made of.  Some amazing time at the beach later and witnessing an incredible sunset we headed to explore some local cuisine. We had tacos at El Paso , followed by churros at Churrosik Park. We had dinner at Los Burritos. As the day winds down, we returned to Hidalgo Avenue for a taste of local nightlife and savor the vibrant energy of Isla Mujeres.

## Day 3:
Next morning we were up early for a beach walk at Playa Centro all the way till Playa Norte. I didn‚Äôt carry my snorkeling kit, but couldn‚Äôt resist to capture some shots of the fish swimming in a lagoon formed near the Maya Reef Resort. Had some delicious breakfast at Penguinos the on-site restaurant at Posada Del Mar. It was now time to say adios to Isla Mujeres as we took our ferry back to Cancun. Our plan was now to take the ADO from Cancun Centro bus stop as we plan to spend our next three nights in Valladolid. 


ADO buses are affordable , comfortable and I would highly recommend to someone who prefers not to drive or rent a car in Mexico. It took us roughly 2.5 hrs to reach Valladolid. Remember that Valladolid‚Äôs time zone is an hour behind Cancun‚Äôs .

Although people visit Cancun which is just 150kms away, they either skip Valladolid or  just make a 40 mins stop At Valladolid during their day trip to Chichen Itza, this is just not enough to soak in the atmosphere and Mayan cultural exposure that one could get in Valladolid. 

Valladolid has a host of unique hotels which are very reasonably priced. They have unique Spanish Colonial architecture and very charming!
We stayed for three nights at the Hotel Real Hispano which is an absolute aesthetic delight and made our stay truly memorable. The hotel is right at the heart of the downtown and provided us with very easy access to everything to see and do in Valladolid.

We didn‚Äôt wait to hit Cenote Zaci , a tranquil oasis within Valladolid. After this went went onto grab some most recommended gelato from the nearby Wabi Gelato. We then headed to Parque Rosado where we were greeted with some amazing Mayan Dance performance. At 6pm every evening there is a walking tour that leaves the park for a two hour walk around the city. I highly recommend this for the great idea about Mayan culture and history. I tried some Cochinita Pibil which were awesome.At the end of what had been a long day we got dinner at a local Mercado .

## Day 4:
Today we leave early to visit the Mayan ruins of Ek Balam.  Once you enter Ek Balam, you'll be greeted by the awe-inspiring pyramid , a towering structure that dominates the landscape. The best part is unlike the more famous ones like Chichen Itza, you climb up the one here at Ek Balam. From its summit, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding jungle.

Now you may visit the Cenote Xcanche,  which is in the same area. We however had a similar cenote experience at Zaci the previous day and therefore headed to Cenote Samula and Xkekem for formation of those are completely different. 

After this we got a chance to have some really hearty  food at a Mayan roadside restaurant. 

Upon returning to Valladolid, we had some amazing coconut IceCream at the park Rosada. 
Also, Don‚Äôt forget to try out the marquesita at the Parque Rosado 

In the evening we saw a fabulous light and sound show projected on the walls of Temple de San Servacio .. the video mapping is about the rich and fascinating history of the Mayans and of the Yucat√°n. 


## Day 5: 
We started early in the morning to get the tickets for the Collectivo that start around 7 am. This allows to reach Chichen Itza before 8am when the ticket windows for the Chichen open. Apart from ElCastillo , we marveled at the ball court, and Sacred cenote. The Temple of the Warriors, adorned with a thousand columns, stood as a testament to the architectural brilliance of the ancient Maya.

After coming back to Valladolid we got some rest at the hotel before heading out to a pleasant stroll down to the Calzada Los Frailes street.  Very pretty pastel colored colonial buildings Lined along a straight street with charming shops, cafes, and boutiques, it's the perfect place to soak in the local ambiance.

We walked all the way to  the Convento San Bernardino. This is where one could find the Letras Valladolid with every word painted in great details.  We wrapped up our last night at Valladolid with another light and sound show at San Bernardino church, followed up with a Mayan show next to it.

## Day 6: 
We started back for Cancun taking the ADO from Valladolid bus stop. Upon reaching Cancun we hired a cab and headed to our accommodation at the Zona Hotelera. It was a great experience driving through the lagoon and showed us glimpses of the fun that Cancun is all about . Our hotel Cancun Plaza condo was right on Playa Delphines one of the most popular and picturesque beaches in Cancun. The best part is the pure azure color of the water of the Carribean Sea.l somehow think it‚Äôs even more blue than what we had seen in Isla Mujeres. 
There was a beautiful infinity pool at the property and we spend most of the afternoon there and got some much needed relaxation.  We then enjoyed our lunch by the pool side restaurant. We decided to walk along the beach to the Letras Cancun which seems to be very popular for family pictures ‚Ä¶ long lines for that one perfect Cancun shot.

## Day 7: 
Our last morning at Cancun couldn‚Äôt have been better with one of the most incredible sunrises of my life. I called for a cab as our dream vacation came to an end. We had already completed our Online checkin, so printed our boarding passes , did the security and well in no time we were at the gates.

So that my friends was our story of exploring the beautiful Yucat√°n. While this was just scratching the surface of a treasure trove that this area is , we didn‚Äôt mind our hectic schedule as we covered a lot in just about a week.

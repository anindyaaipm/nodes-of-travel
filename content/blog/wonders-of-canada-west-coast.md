## Magical Vancouver and Pacific Coast 

Imagine yourself to be a popular YouTuber or Travel Vlogger with 100000 subscribers… write a script about a Pacific Coast escapade experience and an itinerary of 4 days. Take into consideration the following itinerary.

“The Pacific Coast was in my list for a long time .. it was after our Maritimes trip and gave us such a varied perspective about the two coastal landscapes … we thought we saw the best during our Atlantic trip that mother nature has to offer , but we held on our nerves ,as we witnessed Pacific  coast with amazement , as the serenity of the mountains kissing the ocean unfurled before our eyes.

## Day 1: Reaching Vancouver
we took an early morning fight from Toronto Pearson to Vancouver. 
Vancouver’s beauty cannot be compared with any other … Stanley Park is the lungs of the city, arguably rivaling NYC’s Central Park in my opinion… it’s totem poles are spiritual and historic , views from the Brockton Point Lighthouse are breathtaking ! There are horse drawn carriages which are an absolute charm. But I think the Sea Wall walk around the entire perimeter of the park and by the Pacific is what makes it so spectacular … from the port of Vancouver near Canada Place it starts and goes around hugging the ocean with myriad views and moods spread across … in between one could see the amazing Lions Gate bridge, which connects Vancouver to North Vancouver - which by the way is a completely different city - and beyond to the second , third beach through Sunset Beach .  LionsGate lookout is a special place which just cannot be missed … We stayed at North Vancouver after what had been a long first day , and the city is amazing . We drove through Lions Gate bridge which is beautiful…

## Day 2: Exploring Vancouver
The following morning I got a first hand aerial view of beautiful NorthVan… we drove a quick 15 mins to the Lynn Canyon park boasting of a fantastic suspension bridge - quite comparable to Capilano Suspension bridge , which in my opinion is very expensive - Lynn is absolutely free !! From Lynn Canyon we went back to the hotel and took the local transit bus to go to the Lonsdale Ferry Terminal to take the SeaBus. The SeaBus works like a clockwork and connects Vancouver downtown… the spacecraft shaped ferry is quite a charm. It unleashed such phenomenal views of the downtown that we were spellbound. Upon reaching downtown Vancouver we walked 10 mins into the famous GasTown..
The cobblestoned street of GasTown offers an amazing old town charm and hosts the famous musical steam clock … it is quite an experience if one visit’s especially at noon ! GasTown is where Vancouver was established. I happened to enjoy the  Japadog , which was very tasty.

Next it was time to explore the Canada Place at the Vancouver waterfront… the cruises to Alaska were all lined up. This is the place where the SeaPlanes take off and descend and is quite a spectacle in itself. There is ‘The Drop’ and the ‘Olympic Cauldron’ and then there is the famous ‘Digital Orca’. We took an Uber and went to the David Lam park. We took the vibrant Aqua Bus to Granville Island and were amazed at the carnival atmosphere there. Granville Island is famous for its Public Market and boy what a spectacular assortment of local produce and food … simply blew us away !  After spending a couple of hours indulging in the treats and the views we took the return ferry from Granville to go to English Bay. Next to English Bay is the Sunset beach , providing spectacular views of .. well … of course sunsets - but also has a special attraction called the ‘Amazing Laughter’ … it’s an amazing place where you can simply laugh your heart out…
It was a long day as we took our Uber back to the Hotel at North Van.

## Day 3: Sea to Sky Highway & Whistler
Next day , we made a head start along the world famous Sea to Sky Highway… what an amazing journey which took us through the winding roads on the high sierra mountains right next to the fathomless depths of the beautiful Pacific … our first stop was at the Shannon Falls, just outside of Squamish. Shannon Falls is the third highest waterfall in BC. Squamish is the place where we got the chance to experience the Sea to Sky Gondola. I have been to other gondola rides , but the SeaToSky was at another level. It has such amazing views of ‘The Chief’ , the colossal monolith astride Squamish. The gondola 🚡 ride led us to the platform at 3000ft. The view on the way to the summit and from the top is simply stunning.  There is a fascinating suspension bridge called the Sky Pilot , which is completely thrilling … it literally sways and gives ultimate thrilling experience. There is a ‘Panorama Trail’ at the top which leads to another platform with extraordinary views. After the Sea to Sky Gondola , we headed further north to Whistler. Just before entering Whistler , we took the short 15 mins hike to Brandywine Falls … the towering waterfalls crashes down through a punchhole, quite fascinating.  
Overnight at Pinnacle Hotel Whistler was a good experience. We had a great time at the Olympics Village at Whistler, home of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games. 

## Day 4: Hiking Joffre Lakes
Next morning we took another quick round of the beautiful Whistler Olympic village and tried the yummy pastries at PureBread. We checked out from Whistler and  went further up towards Pemberton to dare ourselves to take British Columbia’s most thrilling hike : the Joffre Lake Provincial Park. The three lakes of Joffre Lakes spanning a 10km hike is incredibly difficult but unbelievably scenic.

The electric blue lakes sit right at the base of the glaciers. Just before reaching the Upper Lake there is this HollowWay waterfall, which is the most perfect cascading waterfall we have ever  seen.. the hike was tough but left us wonderstruck with awe and veneration!  
We drove back to Vancouver on the Sea To Sky highway with the fascinating Pacific views to our right. 

## Day 5: Flying Back 
Checked out from our Vancouver hotel drove to the airport lounge to have some good breakfast and it was time to catch our flight back to Toronto.

## Day 1 – Jaipur: The Pink Beginning

We took an early morning flight from Kolkata and landed in Jaipur, famously known as The Pink City.
Our first stop was the beautifully ornate Patrika Gate, an architectural masterpiece that welcomes you with colors and culture from across Rajasthan.

We checked into Dera Rawatsar Heritage Hotel, a charming haveli-style stay in the city center — traditional, elegant, and warm.

Post refreshment, we headed to the iconic Hawa Mahal. With its honeycomb windows and pink façade, it’s the symbol of Jaipur. The best views are from Tattoo Café or Wind View Café right opposite the palace.

As evening descended, we dove into Jaipur’s food scene — tasting the famous Rawat’s Onion Kachori, Laxmi Mishtan Bhandar’s Ghewar, and Dal Baati Churma. The bustling bazaars around Hawa Mahal came alive in colors, aromas, and sounds, perfectly ending our first day.

## Day 2 – Jaipur Exploration and Overnight Train to Jaisalmer

Our day began with Gulabji Chaiwala’s classic bun maska and kulhad chai.
We first stopped at Jal Mahal, floating gracefully in the middle of Man Sagar Lake.

Next, we explored the majestic Amer Fort — Jaipur’s crown jewel. The elephant ride up to the fort made us feel like royalty, and inside, its courtyards and mirror work were mesmerizing. Don’t miss Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas, and Sheesh Mahal.

After Amer, we stopped at the geometric beauty of Panna Meena ka Kund, then visited Jantar Mantar (an astronomical wonder) and the City Palace, rich with history and artifacts of Jaipur’s royal lineage.

As night fell, we boarded the Leelan Express for an overnight journey to the golden city of Jaisalmer.

## Day 3 – Jaisalmer: The Golden City

At dawn, the first rays of sunlight kissed the golden walls of Jaisalmer Fort, greeting us into the Thar Desert.
We stayed at Hotel The Surya, located inside the fort — the sunrise views from the rooftop were unforgettable.

We explored Jaisalmer Fort, Canon View Point, and Dussehra Chowk, followed by the beautifully carved Jain Temples.
Outside the fort, Patwon Ki Haveli stole our hearts with its intricate stonework and lattice windows.

Later, we visited Bada Bagh, home to royal cenotaphs, which turned golden under the setting sun — a photographer’s dream.
We ended the day at Gadisar Lake, where a light and sound show brought the fort’s history alive under the starlit sky.

## Day 4 – Desert Adventure in Sam Dunes

After exploring the Raja and Rani Mahal in Dussehra Chowk, we checked out from our fort hotel and headed toward the Sam Sand Dunes.
On the way, we visited the peaceful Amar Sagar Jain Temple, known for its exquisite carvings.

Evening brought thrill and beauty — dune bashing, ATV rides, and a camel safari as the sun melted into the golden desert.
At night, our desert camp came alive with cultural performances and folk songs — the true spirit of Rajasthan under the open sky.

## Day 5 – Jodhpur: The Blue City

We began our day with a camel ride at sunrise before driving to Jodhpur, the city of royal blue walls.
We stayed at Krishna Prakash Heritage Haveli, offering heritage charm and local warmth.

Evening walks through the Blue alleys and views from Pachetiya Hills were magical.
Later, the Clock Tower Market invited us into its lively chaos — we tasted Shahi Samosa, Mirchi Vada, and Rabri Roti at Vijay Restaurant, and ended with sweets from Mohanji Mithaiwala.

## Day 6 – Mehrangarh Fort and Jaswant Thada

Morning began at Toor Ji Ka Jhalra, an ancient stepwell with stunning symmetry.
We then explored Jaswant Thada, the marble memorial often called the “Taj Mahal of Marwar.”

The highlight was Mehrangarh Fort — majestic, towering, and steeped in history. The museum, cannons, and views of the blue city were breathtaking.
Later, we stopped by Umaid Bhawan Palace and ended our day at Mandore Gardens, the ancient capital of Marwar.

## Day 7 – To Udaipur via Ranakpur

Our next leg took us toward Udaipur, the City of Lakes. En route, we stopped at Ranakpur Jain Temple, an architectural masterpiece set amidst the Aravallis. Its 1,444 intricately carved pillars, each unique, are a sight to behold.

Arriving in Udaipur, we checked into Lake Pichola Hotel — a stunning heritage property right by the lake.
The evening was magical with a boat pickup from Doodhtalai, giving us cinematic views of Udaipur’s skyline.
We visited Gangaur Ghat and ended our evening with the Bagore Ki Haveli cultural show, followed by dinner at Upré overlooking the shimmering Lake Pichola.

## Day 8 – Exploring the City of Lakes

We began early at Ambrai Ghat to witness a magical sunrise.
Later, we visited Fateh Sagar Lake, Saheliyon Ki Bari, and Jagdish Temple, followed by the majestic City Palace — the largest in Rajasthan.

The grandeur, stories of Maharana Pratap, and breathtaking lake views made this palace the highlight of Udaipur.
As evening descended, we took a sunset boat ride on Lake Pichola — a moment where the city’s lights danced upon the water, ending our day on a poetic note.

## Day 9 – Chittorgarh and Departure

On our return journey, we stopped at Chittorgarh Fort, a symbol of courage and sacrifice.
Spread over 700 acres, this fort narrates tales of Rani Padmini, Mirabai, and the spirit of Rajput valor.

From Vijay Stambh to Kirti Stambh, and Padmini Palace to Suraj Pol, every corner of Chittorgarh holds echoes of history — especially the tale of Jauhar, where bravery triumphed over defeat.

With hearts full and minds enriched, our 9-day Rajasthan odyssey came to a close — a journey through colors, courage, and timeless heritage.

Final Thoughts:
From Jaipur’s palaces to Jaisalmer’s dunes, Jodhpur’s blue charm, and Udaipur’s shimmering lakes, Rajasthan is not just a destination — it’s a feeling.
A melody of traditions, colors, and legends that will stay with you long after the journey ends.

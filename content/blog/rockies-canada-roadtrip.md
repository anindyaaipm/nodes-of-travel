At the end of Day 3 we drove to town of Banff .. that was a mistake … instead one should plan to stay nights 4,5,6 at Yoho area … it would be lot more logical.

So Checkin at Field , BC … even better Emerald Lake Lodge of course if you have to book days in advance.

## Day 4 - Reserve this day to explore Yoho National Park.
If coming from Field, make a pit stop at Spiral Tunnel viewpoint. 
Emerald Lake : Start your day canoeing at the amazing Emerald Lake. Grab some lunch at Cilantro On The Lake .. 

Next head to Natural Bridge for a quick stop before heading towards the magnificent takkakaw falls. 
Overnight at Lake Louise Village.

## Day 5 - Lake Louise and Agnes tean House Hike
At Lake Louise, get to the parking early … to beat the crowds as the place can get really crowded.. canoeing is expensive but a great experience… reserve the morning for a hike to the Lake Agnes Tea house and depending on your fitness you can do the complete hike to the Little Beehive. 
Come back to Lake Louise and try to spend some time for atleast grabbing a sandwich at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise .

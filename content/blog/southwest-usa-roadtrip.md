## 🏜️ Day 1 — The Beginning: From Vegas to St. George

The journey begins in Las Vegas, the glittering gateway to the desert.
After a quick stop at the iconic Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign, we hit the open road toward St. George, Utah — the threshold of canyon country.

A quiet evening beneath desert stars set the tone for what lay ahead — nine days of dust, light, color, and wonder.

Overnight: St. George

## 🏞️ Day 2 — Into the Heart of Zion National Park
Rising early, we ventured into Zion National Park, where cliffs rise like cathedrals and rivers carve green pathways through red stone.
We began at the Zion Visitor Center, the perfect place to pick up trail maps and learn from park rangers before setting off.
Then came a series of unforgettable hikes — from the gentle Riverside Walk to the shimmering Emerald Pools, and the panoramic Canyon Overlook Trail.
Driving through the famous Zion–Mount Carmel Highway, the sheer scale of nature took our breath away.


Overnight: St. George

## 🧗 Day 3 — The Epic Ascent: Angels Landing & Bryce Canyon Sunset

At dawn, we set out to conquer Scout Lookout and the legendary Angels Landing — one of the most thrilling hikes in the U.S. The narrow ridge, the dizzying heights, and the views stretching to infinity — it was an experience we’ll never forget.

Exiting Zion, we passed the beautiful Checkerboard Mesa, a perfect farewell to the park.

## Maritimes Canada : Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick 

Welcome to our Canadian maritime adventure, where I’m going to take you on an incredible journey through Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It’s going to be eight days of pure exploration, stunning landscapes, and mouthwatering food. So, sit back, relax, and let’s embark on this unforgettable journey together.

## DAY 1 - Flying to PEI for the Road Trip of a Lifetime

Our journey begins with an early morning flight from Toronto Pearson to Charlottetown, PEI. First stop - the picturesque West Point Lighthouse. We even flew our trusty drone to capture the breathtaking views. Then, it's off to the quirky Canadian Potato Museum for a dining experience you won't believe - lobster in PEI potatoes! Our day ends in the charming Summerside.

## DAY 2 - Hopewell Rocks - New Brunswick

Day 2 brings us to the Port Borden Front Range Lighthouse before we cross the epic Confederation Bridge into New Brunswick. Our destination? The awe-inspiring Hopewell Rocks. Timing was key here, as we arrived just in time for low tide and witnessed the dramatic rising waters from the upper level. Our night is spent in Moncton.

## DAY 3 - Entering into Nova Scotia

Rising early on Day 3, we venture into Nova Scotia. But before that, a pit stop at Nova Scotia's renowned Jost Vineyard for some delightful wine tasting. We then drive to Antigonish, where the local seafood, including fish and chips and seafood chowder, leaves our taste buds dancing. The day ends with us arriving at the mesmerizing Iona Heights Inn on Cape Breton Island, where even overcast skies can't dampen our spirits.

## DAY 4 - Cabot Trail

We kick off Day 4 with an early start from Iona. A small ferry ride at Little Narrows takes us to Baddeck, where the Graham Bell Museum leaves us truly impressed. Uncooperative weather forces us to switch our plans and take the Cabot Trail clockwise, and boy, did that decision pay off! We drive the winding Cabot Trail, and we have lunch in the charming Cheticamp. Entering Cape Breton National Park, we embark on the famous Cabot Trail at the 7 km long Skyline Trail hike, surrounded by the natural beauty of Cape Breton.

Charlottetown beckons us for a glimpse of the capital, where we visit Notre Dame and indulge in the legendary COWS Ice Cream. Our night is at the picturesque Bay Vista in Cavendish.

## DAY 7 - Green Gables , Lighthouses & Beaches Gallore

We rise early to witness a heavenly sunrise at Prince Edward Island National Park. Then, it's off to Cape Tryon Lighthouse for some thrilling off-road driving.

## Maritimes Canada : Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick 

Unbelievably scenic and even more enigmatic with breathtaking landscapes and natural phenomena - 45 foot tidal currents “HOPEWELL ROCKS” - world famous coastal drives , magical beaches, stunning lighthouses -PEGGY’s COVE- and of course “The CABOT TRAIL” - not sure “where do I begin to tell the story” :) 

Unparalleled history and culture - Graham Bell museum at Baddeck to UNESCO site in LUNENBERG, with its colorful houses boasting Atlantic Maritime Museum .  Canadian 10 Cents marquee Blue Nose schooner… to PEI’s Cavendish’s very own Lucy Montgomery’s “ANNE of the GREEN GABLE” historic sites.

And most interestingly these provinces are seafood heaven 🍣 …  ‘To die for’ Fish and Chips at the coveside restaurants to the lip smacking clam chowder ; From the world’s best COWS 🐮  ice cream at Charlottetown to PEI’s best potato 🥔 lobster at the Potato Museum . Again at Nova Scotia from the fresh Lobster 🦞 Rolls at the Fishing village of Cheticamp to the wine tasting experience at the Maritimes’ biggest “Jost Vineyard” … phew … and of course many more :) 

The modes of transportation are also quite unprecedented, be it traveling via the cross provincial 13km long CONFEDERATION BRIDGE, which took us from the PEI to New Brunswick to experiencing the NorthCumberland Ferry (NFL), which took us from Nova Scotia to PEI. 

Natural wonders and scenic sights are something that will keep me going back to these provinces… the winding roads and sheer sights at Cabot Trail os world famous. Considered one of the most fascinating drives in the world it culminates at the 6km long Sunshine Hike/Trail. No words or pictures could do justice to this enchanting hike. Another Nova Scotia special would be the Peggy’s Cove … never seen a better sunset in my life … the setting , with the boulders and the sea is , jaw dropping… 

We flew in and out of Charlottetown, PEI for our Maritime Canada 🇨🇦 vacation … covered PEI, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during the 8 days of our travel … lots of drive abut I didn’t mind at all ! 

PEI :
It might be Canada’s smallest province, but Gosh you cannot imagine how beautiful things could get when it comes to its rich history, culture, scenery and landscape……  From the Black and White “West Point Lighthouse” to the majestic Red Sand cliffs with it’s marquee red and white lighthouses , PEI is home to many of the Atlantic Canada’s best beaches - white sand or red sand , just name it … much like it’s lighthouses - varied yet consistent in beauty .. the best in the world !  

Cavendish lies in the North shore , which is home to the red cliffs and stunning red sand beaches … the food here is amazing, as we tried the freshest “fish and chips” one could ever taste. This place is also home to “Anne’s Green Gables” , kind of a folklore here . The novel has been translated over 40 languages and 50 million copies sold worldwide! 

And then there is Charlottetown,birthplace of Canada as a confederation in 1867, the charming capital. It’s teeming with history at every corner.. We gotta taste the Cows IceCream 🐮 there ! No wonder it’s voted the best icecream in the world ! We also got a chance to visit PEI Potato Museum, and tasted one of the most tastiest meals at the kitchen there 🥔 

Leaving PEI was incredible when we crossed the 13km long Confederation Bridge. For the later part of our trip which got us back to PEI, we took the NFL for a 75 mins long ferry from Caribou, NS to Wood Islands, PEI ; both experiences were fascinating !

We witnessed some of the best sunrises ☀️ , saw some of the best lighthouses and beaches during our stay at PEI and are desperately in love with the island state. 

New Brunswick:
We entered NB from PEI , crossing over the Confederation Bridge. It was a great experience. But the main attraction was the Hopewell Rocks … Two times in a day the the tidal bore gushes to submerge the flower pots or the rocks at the Bay of Fundy and is simply incredible. We kept our exploration of NB for sometime later and spent the night at Moncton. Next morning we drove to Nova Scotia … 


Nova Scotia:
Natural wonders and scenic sights are something that will keep me coming back to Nova Scotia - the winding roads and sheer sights makes Cabot Trail  world famous. Considered one of the most fascinating drives in the world it culminates at the 6km long Sunshine Hike/Trail. No words or pictures could do justice to this enchanting hike. 
We stayed for two nights at a couple of beautiful places at the Cabot Trail and visited the Alexander Graham Bell Museum, which in itself was an enlightening experience.

We checked out the famous Jost Vineyard at the North shore of Nova Scotia .. Also got a chance to try some of the best seafood chowder in the world at a famous fishing village of Cheticamp.

But our  Nova Scotia special would be the Peggy’s Cove … never seen a better sunset in my life … the setting , with the boulders and the sea is jaw dropping. The Peggy’s Cove village is a beautiful quaint fisherman’s town , as if time traveled straight from the 18th century.

We chose to skip Halifax this time as time was limited , but we spent half a day at Lunenberg , a world UNESCO site, with its Victorian era colorful houses and the world famous red colored Atlantic Maritime Museum by the harbour, which also docked the original Blue Nose schooner featured in the Canadian Dime.
